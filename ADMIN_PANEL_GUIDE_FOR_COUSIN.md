## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Photo Tips
- **File size**: Keep photos under 5MB each for faster loading
- **Format**: JPG files work best
- **Quality**: Use high-quality photos for best results
- **Naming**: You don't need to rename files - the system handles it

### Best Practices
- **Thumbnail**: Choose your best/most eye-catching photo as the thumbnail
- **Order**: The first photo you upload will be the first one shown
- **Descriptions**: Write clear, descriptive text so visitors know what they're looking at
- **Project IDs**: Use simple names like `project7`, `project8` - they don't show on the website

### Troubleshooting
- **Photos not uploading?** Check your internet connection and file size
- **Can't save?** Make sure all required fields are filled
- **Changes not showing?** Wait 1-2 minutes for the website to update
- **Forgot password?** Use "Forgot password" on the login page
