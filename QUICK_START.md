# 🚀 Quick Start: No-Code Photo Management System

## ✅ What I've Set Up For You

I've created a **complete no-code photo management system** using Netlify CMS. Your cousin can now add photos through a simple admin panel - no coding required!

### What's Been Created:

1. **Admin Panel** (`admin/` folder)
   - Simple interface for adding/editing photos
   - Looks like a blog editor - super user-friendly!

2. **Data Files** (`_data/` folder)
   - JSON files that store all photo information
   - Automatically updated when photos are added via admin panel

3. **Dynamic Website**
   - Website now loads photos from JSON files
   - Automatically updates when new photos are added

4. **Setup Guide** (`NETLIFY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
   - Complete step-by-step instructions
   - Everything you need to get started

## 🎯 Next Steps (Takes ~15 minutes)

### 1. Deploy to Netlify (Free!)

Follow the instructions in `NETLIFY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`. Here's the quick version:

1. **Create GitHub account** → Create repository → Upload all files
2. **Go to netlify.com** → Sign up with GitHub → Import your repository
3. **Enable Identity** → Enable Git Gateway → Invite your cousin
4. **Done!** Your site is live and your cousin can add photos!

### 2. Share With Your Cousin

Once set up, give her:
- **Website URL**: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- **Admin URL**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin`
- **Her login credentials** (from the invite email)
